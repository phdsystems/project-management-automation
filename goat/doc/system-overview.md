## Feature Matrix

### Core Authentication

- **JWT Lifecycle**: Issue, refresh, revoke tokens with automatic JWK rotation
- **Session Management**: Redis-backed session store with concurrency tracking
- **Password Security**: Argon2id hashing with tunable parameters and breach checks
- **Account Workflows**: Registration, verification, recovery, and status management

### Audit & Compliance

- Comprehensive logging of auth, admin, and configuration activities
- GDPR/CCPA features covering export, deletion, and policy enforcement
- Security analytics: failed login tracking, anomaly detection, concurrent session alerts
- Automated compliance reporting with customizable retention policies

### Multi-Factor Authentication

- TOTP/HOTP with QR provisioning and authenticator compatibility
- SMS and email OTP delivery with throttling and retry controls
- WebAuthn/FIDO2 for hardware keys and biometrics
- Backup code issuance and trusted device flows

### Federation & SSO

- SAML 2.0 SP/IdP support with metadata management and signed assertions
- LDAP/Active Directory bridge plus OIDC provider integrations (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
- Social login adapters for OAuth2 providers with attribute mapping
- Centralized federation management, trust relationships, and session orchestration

### Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection

- Adaptive throttling with behavioral scoring and anomaly detection
- Multi-dimensional limits (global, per-IP, per-user, per-endpoint)
- Redis-backed distributed sliding windows for cluster coordination
- Mitigation options such as CAPTCHA, proof-of-work, and temporary blocks

### Webhook & Event System

- Configurable webhooks with retry policies, signature verification, and delivery history
- Event bus integrations (Kafka, NATS, EventBridge) for downstream pipelines
- Real-time streaming via SSE and WebSocket with filtering
- Dead-letter queues and aggregation for observability

## Architecture

### Authentication Flow

```mermaid

    participant C as Client
    participant G as API Gateway
    participant R as Rate Limiter
    participant A as Auth Service
    participant D as Database
    participant L as Audit Logger
    participant E as Event System
    C->>G: Submit credentials
    G->>R: Check quota
    R-->>G: Allow/Block
    G->>A: Forward request
    A->>D: Validate user
    D-->>A: User record
    A->>L: Write audit entry
    A->>E: Publish event
    A-->>G: JWT / error
    G-->>C: Response
```

### SSO Flow

```mermaid

    participant U as User
    participant P as SSO Provider
    participant S as GOAT SSO Service
    participant M as User Mapping
    participant J as JWT Issuer
    U->>P: Authenticate request
    P-->>U: Redirect with assertion
    U->>S: POST assertion
    S->>P: Validate assertion
    P-->>S: Validation OK
    S->>M: Resolve account
    M-->>S: Principal info
    S->>J: Request JWT
    J-->>S: Token
    S-->>U: Session + JWT
```

## Security Model

- **Defense in Depth**: Layered validation from edge rate limiting to backend policy enforcement
- **Zero Trust Defaults**: Authenticate every call, authorize each resource action
- **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 on the wire, AES-256-GCM for sensitive data at rest
- **Key Management**: Hardware security module integrations and automated rotation
- **Governance**: Configurable retention, tamper-evident audit logs, and policy attestation

## Performance & Scaling

- Horizontally scalable stateless API nodes behind a load balancer
- Asynchronous webhook workers with adjustable concurrency and queue depth
- Redis-backed caching for session/token quick lookups and rate limit counters
- Observability hooks to measure p99 latency, throughput, and error rates per feature

## Monitoring & Observability

- **Metrics**: Prometheus/Grafana dashboards for authentication latency, rate-limit status, queue depth
- **Logging**: Structured logs with trace IDs and security classifications
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry instrumentation across API, services, and data stores
- **Alerting**: Thresholds for auth failures, queue saturation, anomaly detection signals
